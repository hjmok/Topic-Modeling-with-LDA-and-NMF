# Topic-Modeling-with-LDA-and-NMF

For this project, Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization methods are both used to perform unsupervised topic modeling. The models will create a predetermined number of clusters from the articles and questions provided by the datasets, and the user interprets the clusters by assigning topics.
